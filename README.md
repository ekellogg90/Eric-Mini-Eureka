## Description
- Motivation: My motivation for making this was to further my understanding of creating routes
- Why: I built this application in order to create a persistant place to add notes
- What problem does this solve: This solves the problem that local storage had of being unique to each person and not lasting
- What I learned: I learned how to create my own custom routes, how to write data to a file, and how to use render.
- Challanges: Having my file structure setup appropriately so that Render knew where to read was one challenge that took me a while to figure out.
